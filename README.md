# Bulk Image Reziser

A Python script that gets a path to a folder as a constant. It then searches this path for all the image files in it, takes their names (without the extension), creates folders inside the path named as image files. It then makes resizes of original images of 60, 120, 550, 600 and 800 pixels by the bigger side and places these resizes inside the folders named after respective original images. The resulting files are named originalname_resize.extension (for example. file_60.jpeg).
